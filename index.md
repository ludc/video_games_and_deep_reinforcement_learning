## Objectives of the Blog
My objective is to publish a series of articles explaining how ECS can be leveraged to bridge video game programming and deep (reinforcement) learning. The articles are structured to progressively demonstrate how an ECS can be developed 'from scratch' in python and integrated with classical DRL tools, resulting in a powerful learning platform associated to complex and beautiful games.

## The author

I am a deep (reinforcement) learning professor from Sorbonne University on a sabbatical. I worked at Criteo and spent almost 4 years at Meta (FAIR) doing academic research but also concrete projects to democratize the use of RL techniques (e.g have a look at [salina](https://github.com/facebookresearch/salina) which is a wonderful  RL library :) ). I recently joined Ubisoft, going back to my roots since I did AI research and computer science mainly motivated by video games when I was younger. I am right now a research scientist at La Forge.
